## Tools and Functions

### Datacenter Proxies

1. **Obtain a New Datacenter Proxy**: Acquire connection details (`proxy.host` and `proxy.port`) for a new datacenter proxy. Proxies support connections from the requester's IP and can optionally whitelist additional IPs. Specify desired countries or receive a random selection. Proxies are available for a default of 30 minutes.

2. **Extend Expiration Time of a Datacenter Proxy**: Extend the expiration time of an allocated proxy by 30 minutes per request, up to a maximum of 24 hours.

3. **Check Datacenter Proxies Service Status**: Retrieve the current status of the datacenter service, including the total number of available proxies and their distribution by country.

### Residential Proxies

1. **Get User's Traffic Balance**: Access the user's current traffic balance for their monthly subscription.

2. **Check Residential Proxies Service Status**: Obtain the current status of the residential proxy service, detailing the total number of available proxies and their distribution by country.

3. **Obtain a New Residential Proxy**: Get connection details for a new residential proxy, with similar functionality to datacenter proxies, including IP whitelisting and country selection.
